TronWallet Hot Wallet - High secure crypto wallet for your #TRON

Many crypto wallets ask for your private keys, some of them store it on their server. When this happens, you are giving to a third party access to all your assets. This is the same situation that thousands already have been hacked and lost their tokens. Because of that problem we have created TronVault and TronWallet, a cold and hot wallet for TRON that only work with an offline signature process.

TronWallet was built with security in mind. With a powerful 2 Factor Authentication using AWS Cognito, we provide a secure way for user create, sign, send, vote and participate on TRON Network.

TronWallet is available for iOS, Android, Windows, MacOS, Linux, and Web.

For the desktop and web versions, TronWallet sign with sign offline transactions using TronVault and a QR Code reader using the pc or notebook camera.
